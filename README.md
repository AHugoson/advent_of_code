[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) seems like fun, let's give it a shot!

## 2021🕯️

Challenge: Complete the puzzles from a Unix shell, using vim for code editing.

Goal: Become more familiar with working within the shell, and build some tools along the way.

Language: Python, and maybe (probably not) a shell script version.
